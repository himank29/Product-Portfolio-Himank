## Himank's Product Portfolio

This portfolio brings together the PM-related work I have done till now. I like to experimenting with new technologies and ideas. Also, I enjoy sharing my work and connecting with the community. Feel free to reach out or share feedback on anything that excites you! Heads up - there isn't much code in this repo :)

### What's Inside

#### **1. Unearth-AI**
My startup during college. We built a hiring automation tool for early-stage founders. I handled product design, user interviews, and the workflow behind our chatbot and matching engine. The folder has early pitch decks and notes.

#### **2. Insurance Claims Workflow (Agentic AI)**
A technical product workflow I designed for an AI-driven motor insurance claims system. There are some decks and also a few prototypes that I 'vibe coded'. This is from the APM recruiting processes I was a part of.

#### **3. Case Competitions**
A set of PM cases I worked on across request management, ordering flows, and intelligent layers. These were a mix of case competitions and interview assignments. It helped me sharpen product thinking.

#### **4. Writing**
A personal section. These pieces are a documentation of my own journey and hobbies. They aren’t product work, but they shaped how I communicate and reason.
