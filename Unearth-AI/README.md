Unearth AI was a startup that my friends (Agnipratim Nag, Priyam Garg) and I ran in college. We built an intelligent hiring assistant to help early teams sort and rank resumes faster. I designed the workflow, spoke to users, and helped build a simple matching system that cut most of the manual work. The decks here show how the idea evolved from problem to prototype.

*Vibe Basket was the precursor to Unearth. It was a similar LLM-powered recommendation engine, but in the context out outings rather than recruitment!*
